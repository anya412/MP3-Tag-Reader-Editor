🎧 MP3 Tag Editor & Viewer

Command-line MP3 metadata editor built in C — demonstrates strong skills in file I/O, binary parsing, and low-level data handling, essential for embedded and systems programming.

⚙️ Overview

This project reads and edits ID3 tags (Title, Artist, Album, Year, etc.) directly from MP3 files using only standard C libraries.
It demonstrates precise control over file pointers, data offsets, and memory, reflecting disciplined firmware-style C coding.

🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

Binary File Manipulation: Working directly with raw bytes and tag headers.

Command-Line Interface Design: Robust parsing, validation, and error handling.

Modular C Programming: Clean separation between reading, writing, and validation logic.

System-Level Thinking: No external dependencies; fully portable and lightweight.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: C

Libraries: Standard C (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h)

Tools: GCC, Make, Git

Platform: Linux / Unix (CLI-based)
